# My commodore 64 programs when I was a kid

These are programs I recovered from my old Commodore 64 disks. I wrote them
when I was around 10-12 years old. Earlier stuff has been lost, but considering it was on tape and my initial coding
it was probably not particulary interesting.

Some of this stuff is probably copied from books and personalised. Other was written together with a friend (hence the
A & B soft mark).

## Gestione C-64

Utility I wrote to manage disk and other features of the C64

## imgread

Apparently an image reader from koalapaint data.

## Readdisk

Seems to be something that reads a disk block and shows its content in hex

## Archivio

Contact archive. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Alta risoluzione

Some sort of spirograph drawing program. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Simulaz. dadi

Dice throwing simulator.

## Doodler

I have absolutely no clue

## ULPV (una lettera per volta)

Prints one letter at a time, slowly.

## Elicottero

A little toy program that flies a helicopter sprite. Interestingly had a code quick save feature at line 63998-63999.

# Mastermind

Play mastermind (guess the number)
