# My commodore 64 programs when I was a kid

These are programs I recovered from my old Commodore 64 disks. I wrote them
when I was around 10-12 years old. Earlier stuff has been lost, but considering it was on tape and my initial coding
it was probably not particulary interesting.

Some of this stuff is probably copied from books and personalised. Other was written together with a friend (hence the
A & B soft mark).

## Gestione C-64

Utility I wrote to manage disk and other features of the C64. I had multiple
versions of this application, and I kept adding more and more features or
modifying the graphics.

## imgread

Apparently an image reader from koalapaint data.

## Readdisk

Seems to be something that reads a disk block and shows its content in hex

## Archivio

Contact archive. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Alta risoluzione

Some sort of spirograph drawing program. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Simulaz. dadi

Dice throwing simulator.

## Doodler

I have absolutely no clue

## ULPV (una lettera per volta)

Prints one letter at a time, slowly.

## Elicottero

A little toy program that flies a helicopter sprite. Interestingly had a code quick save feature at line 63998-63999.

# Mastermind

Play mastermind (guess the number)

## Entrap

TRON-like game. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Blob squasher

Like a snake game, minus the tail growth. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Sim movimento

Some kind of "road scrolling" simulation. It seems very slow, but it might be the emulator. I need to try it on the real hardware.

## Numeri romani

Converts numerical value to roman numeral

## mcd-mcm

Computes greatest common divisor and lowest common multiple of a pair of numbers

## Slot machine

simulates a slot machine. Probably copied from somewhere.

## Grafica

changes a letter to a different graphical glyph.

## Labirinto

Various versions of a labyrinth game.

## Conto

I have no idea.

## media

Computes the average of a set of values

## LED

Scrolling of text

## pass

A "password check"

## carica

Not sure. Seems to be loading something.

## oa

Alphabetically orders a set of names.

## header

Changes the header of a disk. Probably copied from somewhere as it's in English.

## porta

Apparently a reaction time test to assess if I was able to be an effective goalkeeper when I played soccer.

## ia (artificial intelligence)

Apparently a sort of toy to prank my friends in believing I had developed artificial intelligence. It 
asks how many letters has a word to guess, then proceeds to ask facts about the subject. Between every
facts, it asks to press a key, but since I would be the one at the keyboard, I would not simply play
a random key. Instead I would write the actual word letter by letter, then it would be printed out
at the end giving the illusion that it figured it out by itself.
